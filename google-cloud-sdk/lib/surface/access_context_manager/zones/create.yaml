                  Allows resources within this access zone to import and export
                  data amongst themselves.

                  A project may belong to at most one regular access zone.
            - arg_value: bridge
              enum_value: ZONE_TYPE_BRIDGE
              help_text: |
                  Allows resources in different regular access zones to import
                  and export data between each other.

                  A project may belong to multiple bridge access zones (only if
                  it also belongs to a regular access zone). Both restricted and
                  unrestricted service lists, as well as access level lists,
                  must be empty.
